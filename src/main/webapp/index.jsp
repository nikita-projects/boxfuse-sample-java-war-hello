<h1>Hi, LevelUP Team!</h1>

<h2>I've prepare simple page for you.</h2>

<p>Your courses do the most important thing - help you find time for self-improvement. I can no longer say to myself "I'll do it another time" or "I'll study it later."</p>
<p>At the very least, you just sit down and start doing everything during the lesson.</p>

<p>Please excuse me for not sending you homework.<br>I just didn't understand who exactly they should be sent to, and I was not going to clarify to whom :)</p>

<p>You can find my homework here (although I doubt anyone really needs them).</p>

<p>Best wishes to you!</p>
